# Problem 30 - Sort array of fractions

# Implement a function, called sort_fractions(fractions) 
# where fractions is a list of tuples of the form (nominator, denominator).
# Both the nominator and the denominator are integers.
# The function should return the list, sorted in increasing order.

# Signature

# def sort_fractions(fractions):
#     # Implementation
    
# Test examples

#     >>> sort_fractions([(2, 3), (1, 2)])
#     [(1, 2), (2, 3)]
#     >>> sort_fractions([(2, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)])
#     [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
#     >>> sort_fractions([(5, 6), (22, 78), (22, 7), (7, 8), (9, 6), (15, 32)])
#     [(22, 78), (15, 32), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 6), (22, 7)]
