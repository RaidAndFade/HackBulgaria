# MailList Problem

This is an implementation of the MailList problem.

The idea is to work with a code, that is not yours. Navigate around the code and see how things are done.

After this, it's time for some refactoring in teams:

* Fix bugs, if any (hint - run the tests with ```python run_tests.py```)
* Replace the files with sqlite for storage
* Implement the rest of the functionality

Everything should be done in OOP way with Test Driven Development approach in teams of 2.
